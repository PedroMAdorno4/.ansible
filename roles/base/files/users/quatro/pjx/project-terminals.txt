#Comments are added like this

~/pjx/novelhalla:
  pnpm run dev --host
  <blank>

#Projects must be separated by at least one blank line
#~/second/project/here: - project path, must end with ':'
#  node - opens a terminal and runs node on it
#  <blank> - opens a terminal with no command
# <blank> parsing needs to be added to the script
# Maybe I should add support for adding a line that will get typed in the terminal but the command won't run (maybe with xdotool?)
